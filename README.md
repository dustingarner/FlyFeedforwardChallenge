# FlyFeedforwardChallenge
 Maximizing the feedforward pathway in the Full Adult Fly Brain connectome.

This codebase implements GreedyFAS, [Section 2.3 of this paper](http://www.vldb.org/pvldb/vol10/p133-simpson.pdf) in order to solve Arie Matsliah's "Feedforward Sort with Minimum Feedback" challenge as found [here](https://codex.flywire.ai/app/mfas_challenge).

## Install
`pip install pandas`
The necessary connectome_graph.csv file can be downloaded from [here](https://codex.flywire.ai/app/mfas_challenge?download=connectome_graph) and placed in the same directory as main.py.
